GENERAL USAGE

Commands may be sent via private message, or prefixed with ! in channels.

Commands submitted in channel will be replied to in channel (not private).

COMMANDS

  btinfo <index> returns entries matching <index>
  btinfo <nickname> returns entries set by <nickname>

btset <index> <[[action]~[timespec]] [comment]>

  Sets the action, expiry time and/or comment for an existing entry.
 
  One of [timespec] or [comment], or both (in order) is required.
 
  [action] may only be specified with a [timespec], not without.

  Examples:

    btset 43221 Trolling
    btset 43221 ~48h
    btset 43221 ~48h Trolling
 
  For details on [timespec], see TIME SPECIFICATION section below
  For details on [action], see ACTIONS section below.
  
COMMENTS

For each new ban added in a channel (with +b), the bantracker bot will private
message the user who set the ban, asking for a comment (reason) to be added.
 
The content of the reply to that message is saved, and then visible in btinfo
results. If more than one ban was set, you will be prompted for a comment for
each in turn.
  
The default expiry time of the ban (channel dependent, typically 24 hours) can
be changed when adding a [comment], by prefixing it with a ~[timespec]. For
example: "~14d Trolling"

TIME SPECIFICATION

When adding a comment or using the btset command, times can be specified in 
[w]eeks, [d]ays, [h]ours, [m]inutes, [s]econds or in any combination together.

Examples:

  ~1h       1 hour from the time it is set.
  ~4h1m4s   4 hours, 1 minute and 4 seconds from the time it is set.
  ~48h      48 hours from the time it is set. (Equivalent to ~2d).
  ~14d      14 days from the time it is set.
  ~2w       2 weeks from the time it is set. (Equivalent to ~14d)

ACTIONS

Expiry time specifications (timespec) can optionally be prefixed
with a single character that sets the action that should be taken
when that ban entry expires.

  # - Reports the expired ban to the report channel only, or does nothing if a
      report channel is not set.
  @ - Removes the ban if the bot has operator status, or report the ban (as above)
      if it does not.
  % - Bot attempts to gain operator status using ChanServ and remove the ban. Takes
      no further action if this cannot be done.
